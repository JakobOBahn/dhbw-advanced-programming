== How To's

=== Duplicate a new IntelliJ module on the base of another module

Follow these steps to create a new module in an IntelliJ project, here for example `Programmierung-II-W3WI-109`. Created module shall be named `course-2` as an example, using the settings of `course-1`:

. Open project dialog:

 File > Project Structure ...

. Select project modules in the dialog:

 Project Settings > Modules

. Add a new module using the `+` sign, specify a unique name, for example `course-2`.

. Accept settings as proposed by clicking `Create`. The new module now appears in the project view!

. Open the `iml` file from `course-1.iml` as the source for settings. Copy the full file contents simply into the previously created new module file, here `course-2.iml`. Save and exit.

. Optional: Simply copy `/src` and maybe also `/test` directories if you want to have existing code in the new module.

The new module now has (code and) settings of the source module!
